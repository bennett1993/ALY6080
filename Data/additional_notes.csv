Only change is that I started my new job on Wednesday the 1st, but did 2 clinicals at that site and am very comfortable there. I have no idea what caused it. I'm always dizzy but have never been this bad. 

Dizziness feels like I'm being pushed forwards and backwards and causes me to sway in front of people. Like getting off an elevator and feeling like you're moving, except my sensation is forwards and backwards instead of up/down. Righting reactions are still WNL but are more active as a result of the swaying. Gets worse with visual overstimulation, standing still/not moving, and social situations. Have to prop myself against doorways or sit down while talking to people at work. Gets better with movement, crossing midline, proprioceptive heavy work, etc. and I am still able to drive safely. Intolerant to sagittal and rotary vestibular input, but seem to tolerate A-P vestibular input well. 

Was able to go for a 50 minute outdoor walk today with an avg heart rate of 100 bpm (post beta-blocker), mild dizziness. ",2022-06-09 01:14:06,2022-06-09

2000,834f7edb-8ec3-4e2c-83fc-b42d6ffb433b,"In summarizing my own subjective thoughts about parasym plus, environmental triggers, and physiological triggers, I have some conclusions of my own: 
-Parasym plus helped a little bit to calm down my nervous system, as evidenced by being able to better access the parasympathetic system when close to threshold (but not over threshold). 
-Parasym plus improved my digestion
-Parasym plus somewhat improved my heart sensations
-Parasym plus decreased my conscious feelings of anxiety
-I do not think that parasym plus directly helped with my dizziness. However, dizziness and anxiety are always correlated (not sure about causation though), so if parasym plus calms the nervous system, then it dampens the catalystic affect of anxiety on dizziness
-Dizziness triggers include computer time, being at work, PMS/menstrual cycle, grocery stores, standing/sitting still, talking to people, and not being mentally engaged/distracted
-Work is a trigger because that's where I have experienced many somatic sensations (heart sensations, faint feelings) that have triggered fight/flight/freeze in the past. My uncounscious brain has coupled the environment at work with these traumatic sensations, as evidenced by experiencing fight/flight/freeze adrenaline surges at specific times of the day and with specific patients that I have had these sensations while treating. Additionally, the added anxiety of pressuring myself to do extremely well at work adds to this. Although I am not consciously anxious at work, it is an unconscious trigger that is attached to past experiences of traumatic sensations. 
-Grocery stores are also a trigger due to triggering somatic sensations in the past
-All symptoms (dizziness, palpitations, adrenaline surges, migraines, etc.) all seem to have some connection to hormones. Specifically, these get worse during PMS and my period. 
-I do not know what triggers severe, dysfunctional migraines. They happen about 1-2x per year randomly. ",2022-07-12 03:37:56,2022-07-12
